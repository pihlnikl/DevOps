# Course project â€“ personal report

This project is meant to expand on the slack bot example provided here https://blog.logrocket.com/build-a-slackbot-in-node-js-with-slacks-bolt-api/. I figured I would keep the /knowledge and /update functions, and instead focus on adding to the back-end by adding some helpful functions. I added a manual approval stage for any updates in the code, mainly with the intention of requiring manual approval if someone wants to add or remove things from the slack bots database of answers.
